# Couroutines
This branch is used for seventh week assignments where I am beginning to work
with couroutines.

File ```word_search.py``` is example shown in our lessons. 
Second file called ```scheduler.py``` is my code where I'm trying to figure out
how the couroutines are working, trying to understand it, and I created some really 
easy program which is basically just sending data from one ```function``` to another.
First function is iterating an array, then sending it to couroutine which is
waiting for these data. This function do some job with these data and forward it
to the last couroutine. This one once again do something with it (simulating some work)
and leaves.\
Every function has ```print()``` so I can see what's going on and when.
